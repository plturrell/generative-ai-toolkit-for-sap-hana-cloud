# Deployment Status Report

## Together.ai Backend Deployment

I attempted to deploy the backend to Together.ai using both the CLI and direct API calls, but encountered some challenges:

1. The Together CLI couldn't be found in the path even after installation in the virtual environment
2. Direct API calls returned errors that suggest either:
   - The API key might have permissions issues
   - The API endpoint structure might have changed
   - There might be formatting issues with the request payload

### Recommended Next Steps for Backend Deployment

1. Use the Together.ai web interface as described in the `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
   - Log in to [Together.ai Console](https://api.together.xyz/console)
   - Navigate to "Deployment" > "Endpoints"
   - Create a new endpoint with the settings from our configuration

2. Alternatively, set up the GitHub Actions workflow as described in `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
   - Add the Together.ai API key as a GitHub Secret
   - Trigger the deployment workflow with the appropriate parameters

## Vercel Frontend Deployment

For the Vercel frontend, you can:

1. Use the Vercel web interface:
   - Log in to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new project from your GitHub repository
   - Configure it with the settings from our generated configuration

2. Or set up the GitHub Actions workflow as described earlier.

## Checking Deployment Status

Once deployment is complete, you can use the provided verification script to test the deployment:

```bash
python deployment/test_deployment.py \
  --backend-url https://api.together.xyz/v1/sap-hana-ai-toolkit-backend \
  --frontend-url https://sap-hana-ai-toolkit.vercel.app \
  --api-key YOUR_TOGETHER_API_KEY \
  --verbose
```

## Summary

While I couldn't complete the direct deployment due to environment constraints, all the necessary configurations, documentation, and tools have been prepared and committed to the repository. You can now proceed with the deployment using either the web interfaces or the GitHub Actions workflow, following the detailed instructions provided in the documentation files.
